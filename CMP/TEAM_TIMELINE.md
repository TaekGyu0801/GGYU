## 2026-10-10 (latest terminal result; exact capture time not given) — FAST_C1 n6 active MinStep/Iterations/RHSMin confirmed (OBSERVED)

- 이택규가 서버의 **실제 전처리 입력** `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/pp6_des.cmd`에서 `grep -nE 'MinStep|Iterations|RHSMin'` 출력 제공. Line 766 `RHSMin=1e-3`, line 828 `Iterations=500`, line 839 `Iterations=100`, line 856 `MinStep=1e-9`, line 875 `Iterations=15`. Iterations=500/100은 별도 Solve 블록에 있으나 전체 문맥은 이번 grep만으로 직접 확인 불가. Transient BE step Newton 반복은 실제 실패 로그에서 15회 초과 후 cutback.
- FAST_C1 n6의 최종 시도 `Stepsize: 1.2174e-09 s`에 대해 Newton 실패 후 기존 로그 패턴상 0.5× cutback은 `6.087e-10 s`이며, 이는 확인된 `MinStep=1e-9 s`보다 작음. 따라서 `Step-size is too small` **수치 종료 조건은 확인됨**. 단 Newton 불안정의 근본 원인이 물성, 메쉬, Mg, 파라미터, 경계 조건 중 무엇인지는 여전히 UNRESOLVED.
- 종료 전 마지막 표기 anode=4.801E+00 V, target 5V 미도달, 2026-10-10 17:39:07 process exit. `n6_des.tdr` 생성됨에도 정상 목표 달성/재시작 checkpoint 아님. 이미 완료된 `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` 별도 소자와 혼동 금지. CAL n2 최신 직접 기록 약 4.142V, 후속 결과 미확인.
- 다음: READ ONLY `sed -n '815,885p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/pp6_des.cmd`로 실제 Solve의 MinStep/Increment/Decrement/Iterations/Goal/Save를 정확히 구분하고, 후보 수정이나 재실행 이전에 전처리 입력과 실패 위치를 점검. 기존 FAST 및 CAL 계산파일 보존. 서버 변경 없음.

## 2026-10-10 (last log time unspecified) — FAST_C1 n6 tiny BE-steps oscillate near 4.801V; final minimum step failure (OBSERVED)

- Worker 이택규 supplied filtered **actual** `GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/n6_des.log` tail. Pseudo-time printed `0.960247 s` on successive BE attempts (6 decimal digits only), corresponding to ~4.801235 V at unchanged 0→5V ramp. Last repeated anode printed `4.801E+00V`, not proof exact zero time advancement.
- Seen rejected timestep trials: `9.0176e-08, 4.5088e-08, 2.2544e-08` s; some intervening **accepted** attempts printed with anode current (e.g. following `1.1272e-08, 6.7632e-09, 1.0145e-09` s). Newton alternated failures and very small accepted progress. Last rejected attempt `1.2174e-09 s` immediately followed by `Step-size is too small.`
- If the previously documented `MinStep=1e-9 s` is indeed active in **this actual pp6 deck**, next 0.5× cutback = `6.087e-10s`, explaining stopping threshold. This must be verified against `GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/pp6_des.cmd` (not yet shown).
- Earlier detailed n6 Newton tail alternated electron C-norm errors ~0.966 and ~74.4 at adjacent x=0.119–0.120um, y=2.617188um; Poisson and hole errors small there. **Electron-equation instability seen, underlying physics/material/mesh root cause unproven**; cannot blame Mg/traps without regional/model checks.
- Prior process end: 2026-10-10 17:39:07 KST after 525152.85s wallclock, n6_des.tdr written at failure. No successful 5V. Last 4.801V/5V≈96.02% *voltage* sweep only.
- CAL n2 separate: latest direct observed ~4.142 V accepted, 5V/100ns override unresolved; no new CAL evidence in this turn. Preserve active CAL and prior completed 5V_TEST parent.
- NEXT READ-ONLY: inspect exact preprocessed FAST_C1 pp6 `MinStep`, `Iterations`, `RHSMin`, and solving block; save logs/tdr; do not merely lower MinStep, rerun 145h or claim saved TDR is restart checkpoint. No school-server changes.

## 2026-10-10 (after ~19:02 KST, exact capture time unknown) — FAST_C1 n6 last printed V 4.801, MinStep failure before 5V (OBSERVED)

- 작업자 이택규 제공 `grep -n 'anode ' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/n6_des.log | tail -n 5` 실제 로그: lines 239133, 239222, 239344, 239400, 239532 모두 `anode 4.801E+00`, electron 4.594E-14, hole 5.318E-12, total 5.364E-12 (raw SDevice output units). 로그는 3-decimal V이므로 마지막 다섯 로그 행의 정확한 t/V 동일성은 미증명.
- 앞서 캡처한 동일 n6 전체 종료 로그: 15 Newton iterations exceeded → `Newton didn't converge, trying again with smaller timestep` → `Step-size is too small` → wrote n6_des.tdr, process exited 2026-10-10 17:39:07, wallclock=525152.85s. `simulation finished / Good Bye`는 성공 의미 아님.
- 마지막 **표시 전압** 4.801V / 목표 5V = 96.02% of sweep, 0.199V remaining; NOT runtime completion, and last exact accepted BE step/time, checkpoint validity and fundamental divergence cause unresolved. No confirmed 5V in this FAST_C1 node. Do not infer 4.801 V is exact last converged to >3 decimals from grep alone.
- Separate CAL n2 latest user log ~4.142V accepted; no new CAL observation in this turn. Completed JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST parent preserved.
- NEXT READ ONLY: `grep -E 'Computing BE-step|Finished, because|Step-size is too small|Newton didn.t converge|anode ' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/n6_des.log | tail -n 35` to see last BE transitions/timestep/rejections/accepted contact; optional `n6_des.sta`. Preserve current TDR/log, do not rerun nor change MinStep/iterations yet. Current chat made no simulator changes.

## 2026-10-10 after 19:02 KST — FAST_C1 n6 MinStep failure confirmed; CAL n2 advances to ~4.142 V (OBSERVED LOG)

- 작업자 이택규가 학교 서버 실제 터미널 로그 두 개 제공. FAST_C1 `GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/n6_des.log` (NtSide=0)는 반복 Newton 15회 초과 후 `Newton didn't converge, trying again with smaller timestep...` 그리고 `Finished, because... Step-size is too small.`가 나타남. 2026-10-10 17:39:07 KST 정상 프로그램 종료 메시지 `simulation finished`, `Good Bye !`, `n6_des.tdr` 쓰기 및 라이선스 반환이 있더라도 5V 목표 달성/물리적 성공이 아니라 **수치적 최소 time-step 실패**. Wallclock 525152.85s ≈145h52m32s, peak mem 5.94GB. 마지막 accepted voltage는 제공된 50줄에 없어 UNRESOLVED; 깊은 원인(물성/mesh/수치 설정) 역시 확정 불가.
- 별개 프로젝트 `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL/n2_des.log`에서 t=0.828339→0.828343s BE step은 Newton 2회 후 `|RHS| less than 1e-3`로 accepted, 표기 anode=4.142E+00 V, total current=4.678E-14 raw. 기존 4.138V보다 약 0.004V 진전(4.142/5≈82.84% 전압 구간이지 walltime 아님). 후속 t=0.828343→0.828348s attempt은 Iteration 11까지 `RHS≈1.09e-03 >1e-03`; 스크린샷/로그가 중간에 끝나 아직 accepted/failure 미확인. 5V 완료·tau_max=100ns 실제 유효성·ETA 미확인.
- 변경: GitHub 진단 기록뿐. 학교 서버 소스, SWB, 실행 중 CAL, 완료된 `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` 결과는 건드리지 않음.
- NEXT READ-ONLY: `grep -n 'anode ' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/GaN_PiN_Diode_FAST_C1/n6_des.log | tail -n 5` 로 FAST 마지막 성공 전압을 확인하고 n6_des.sta/err 및 버전 비교. CAL은 시간 경과 뒤 tail로 accepted t/V, `Newton didn't converge`, step-size, fatal/Good Bye 여부 확인. FAST n6 즉시 재실행 또는 MinStep/Iterations 임의 완화 금지.

## 2026-10-10 ~18:33 KST — 주수빈 5V Baseline signed DopingConcentration vertical cutline linear-axis verified (OBSERVED UI)

- 주수빈 provided Sentaurus Visual screenshot of completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des.tdr`, NtSide=0, after toggling Cutline_Y Plot from logarithmic to linear Y-axis. Existing vertical (growth-axis X) cutline at lateral Y≈1.0 μm passes clean semiconductor away from physical damaged sidewall.
- Direct plotted `DopingConcentration` shows roughly −3×10^17 cm^-3 upper p-side, multiple narrow variations around EBL/MQW, and roughly +5×10^18 cm^-3 constant plateau in n-GaN. The graph shows a step-like nominal signed net-doping distribution along this cutline. Numerical transition boundary and dopant activation details are NOT precisely extracted at this zoom.
- This is not a direct measurement of raw Mg input 9.59×10^18 cm^-3, `hDensity`, ionized Mg fraction, Mg diffusion, or actual physical SIMS depth profile. The loaded 5V output remains a Transient endpoint, not independently proven equilibrium or steady-state.
- Next read-only GUI validation: zoom cutline X≈0–0.4 μm to distinguish p-GaN/EBL/MQW region steps, then show `hDensity` and optionally `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration` and `pMagnesiumMinusConcentration` where available. Preserve original saved results and ongoing separate CAL n2 job; no source changes.

## 2026-10-10 — Kou 2019 nominal epitaxy doping vs CMP step-constant profiles reviewed (REVIEWED / NO SOLVER CHANGE)

- 작업자: 주수빈. 사용자가 layer별 동일 도핑을 구현한 실제 CMP 모델의 문헌 타당성을 재질문. 실제 Kou et al., *Optics Express* 27 A643-A653 (2019) Section 2, DOI 10.1364/OE.27.00A643 확인.
- **Direct paper:** n-GaN 4 μm Si doped 5e18 cm^-3; p-Al0.15Ga0.85N EBL 26nm and p-GaN cap 120nm each **hole concentration** 3e17 cm^-3 (Mg dopant concentration이라고 보고하지 않음); 20nm heavily doped p-GaN ohmic contact layer **also specified**. Paper does not specify SIMS-calibrated vertical concentration profile or graded Mg transition function. Therefore uniform-per-layer SDE doping is a defensible simplifying *interpretation*, NOT proved literal reproduction of growth profiles or proof authors applied exact constant doping commands.
- **Existing CMP actual 2026-10-09 pp1 audit:** N_Mg_p=9.59e18 cm^-3 nominal Mg input in Clean/DmgL pGaN with incomplete-ionization SDevice physics; nominal p-GaN 3e17 target is hole density, not identical to Mg input. A single SVisual sample hDensity~3.001e17 was reported at one 5V result point and cannot establish unbiased whole-depth calibration. EBL nominal effective acceptor 3e17, n-GaN donors 5e18, barrier 1e15 (numerical assumption). Region-based constant input does not imply constant mobile electron/hole density under bias.
- **Paper/model gap:** a separate 20nm highly doped p-GaN contact cap occurs in Kou; CMP COMMON_BASELINE vertical stack does not list that separate p+ region, though exact live SDE current geometry/contact doping must be checked before treating it as confirmed omission.
- **Experimental context:** Gutt et al. PSS C (2011), DOI 10.1002/pssc.201001039 and Bakhtiary-Noodeh et al., Journal of Crystal Growth 602 (2023) 126962 DOI 10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2022.126962 support real Mg memory/back-diffusion/graded near-boundary profiles; no direct SIMS profile for the CMP representative device has been supplied. Avoid inventing gradient depth/concentrations.
- **Decision PROPOSED, NOT RUN:** retain current original and CAL running job unchanged; perform read-only vertical SVisual cutline of nominal Mg species, ionized Mg/net doping, hDensity and EBL; verify p+ contact layer/source. If experiment needed, create separately versioned sensitivity branch with literature/SIMS-backed graded Mg interface and same mesh/physics, compare QW hole injection, I(V), SRH/Rrad/current at matched injection. No code, parameter, or SWB job modified.

## 2026-10-10 ~18:07 KST — 주수빈 CAL 진행 상태 스크린샷 확인 (OBSERVED)

- 주수빈이 이택규의 기존 `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` NtSide0 실행 상황을 SWB Node n2 Output 창으로 공유. 직전 accepted step 뒤 displayed anode=4.138 V, next BE attempt pseudo-time 0.82766 -> 0.827663 s. 이전 기록 4.122 V보다 약 0.016 V 진전. 5 V 기준 약 82.76% 전압 스윕이며 wallclock 진행률 아님.
- 다음 단계 수렴/5 V 완료/100 ns override effective 여부는 화면에서 확정 불가. `n2_des.err` E0 warning은 fatal 원인으로 확정하지 않음. 서버 소스/작업은 변경하지 않음.
- NEXT: 현재 실행 유지, 후속 로그 read-only 확인과 5 V 성공 후 이전 1 ns Baseline 대조.

## 2026-10-10 12:09 KST — CAL SDevice continues running in SWB (USER-REPORTED / LOG UNVERIFIED)

- Worker 이택규 reports that the previously launched `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` SDevice still appears **running** in SWB at ~12:09 KST on Oct 10, with no completion observed.
- Start time described as "어제 새벽 1~2시" (literally Oct 9 01:00–02:00), which would imply 34h09m–35h09m elapsed, but the same CAL project's SDE meshing was previously screenshot-confirmed completed **Oct 10 00:11:50 KST**. A **different interpretation of the date** (Oct 10 01:00–02:00) implies 10h09m–11h09m; therefore actual start date/time is **UNRESOLVED**, and must not be treated as known.
- **SWB running display is user-reported only**; there is no freshly supplied CAL `n2_des.log` or `n2_des.out`, no observed accepted BE steps/current voltage, no proof the 100ns material override was applied, and no reliable ETA. Do not call this a hang or success.
- Next **READ ONLY**: inspect `tail -n 40 /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL/n2_des.log` and the SWB job/experiment identity and start timestamp; compare changing accepted-voltage/current and Newton retry patterns. Keep existing run and original completed 5V parent intact; no parameter/source edits while it is running.

## 2026-10-10 — Joint researcher naming convention applies to future JuSubin work (DECISION)

- Worker 이택규 requests all **future new CMP** projects created by either researcher (이택규 or 주수빈) follow `CMP_<TYPE>_<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>_<TAG>` (e.g. BASELINE/PROJECTA/PROJECTB). Current naming guide and AGENTS.md updated so any AI/Claude session reading the repo can follow it.
- Scope is new projects/user-authored releases; preserve Sentaurus native tool-input/output file names and preexisting archives/projects to avoid breaking SWB links. No claim that 주수빈 has acknowledged or already renamed projects. No solver edits/runs in this policy update.

## 2026-10-10 — 이택규 CAL input candidate created off-server, no simulator run (PROPOSED / STATIC CHECKED)

- User provided installed T-2022.03 InGaN.par SRH/Auger/Radiative section proving vendor's GaAs-derived 1ns lifetime warning and default coefficients. Private ChatGPT downloadable `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL_INPUT_CANDIDATE.zip` generated from validated 5V_TEST input files: same SDE, same executed SDevice sweep/model (comments corrected only), GaN Mg and crystal orientation intact, InGaN SRH Scharfetter tau_max set to 100ns both carriers in custom .par. This is a *literature sensitivity proposal*, not calibrated or run. New SWB clone pending.

## 2026-10-10 — 이택규 verified actual 5V parent model via uploaded HDF5 archive (OBSERVED/DERIVED)

- Baseline candidate `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL` under preparation, not yet created; confidential nine-file input and result archive read privately by GPT. Audit without proprietary contents: `CMP/reviews/BASELINE_1_2_0_CAL_AUDIT_20261010.md`.
- Strong model discovery: every Clean/DmgL 5V QW rate field follows Radiative B=2e-10, Auger C=1e-30, and SRH tau=1ns. Mg incomplete ionization produces reduced net doping through 0.031286 maximum pGaN occupation. 5V current remains low, physical calibration remains open.
- SDevice code comments incorrectly advertise 4V/4.5V/4.8V Saves and staged increment; actual run only had 5V Save and constant Increment=1.2. No code modifications or new solver job.

## 2026-10-09 — CMP naming/version policy confirmed by 이택규 (DECISION)

- Use `CMP_<TYPE>_<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>_<TAG>` for new project candidates; see `CMP/PROJECT_NAMING_CONVENTION.md`. New proposed Baseline candidate: `CMP_BASELINE_1.2.0_CAL`, not yet an existing simulation. PROJECTA/B have independent version histories; preserve parent Baseline provenance and NtSide run metadata.
- Existing 5V_TEST private artifact filenames and sizes confirmed in server shell; no new code or simulation generated. Retain the previous completed 5 V NtSide0 run and pre5V archive.

## 2026-10-08 — 주수빈 Half+coarse SDevice QS 가속 시험 후보

- 작업자: 주수빈; 상태: PROPOSED / CODE STATIC PASS; 런타임 미검증.
- Half+coarse mesh (138,194 elements) 생성/visual gate 통과 후, SDevice Transient 0→0.3V smoke 한 step 약 109.74s 중 solve 약 90.20s를 관찰.
- steady-state I-V/IQE 목적에 더 적합하고 adaptive step 수를 줄일 수 있는 Quasistationary 0→0.3V 별도 시험 deck 작성. 원래 Physics/Trap/Math/ILS 및 initial Poisson/Coupled 유지, QS ramp 설정만 신규.
- 원본 full FAST_C1/Project A/B 기준 모델은 변경하지 않음. 짧은 smoke와 full-reference 동등성 시험 전 production 채택 금지.

## 2026-10-08 — Fast pilot direction: half-domain + relaxed remote bulk mesh

- 작업자: 이택규; 상태: PROPOSED / NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- Time-constrained request: run a **separate experimental branch** applying both half-domain symmetry and modest remote bulk/numerical n-GaN coarsening to investigate runtime, without stopping existing FAST_C1 or changing frozen physical baseline parameters.
- Must verify exact active SDE contacts/doping/geometry symmetry and retained-side 5nm physical damage; preserve MQW, EBL, heterointerfaces and damage/edge refinement; avoid changing tolerance/traps/polarization simultaneously.
- One combined pilot provides feasibility data, not independent attribution of speedup. Requires SDE mesh review + actual preprocessed region/physics scope review + short solver smoke before longer run.
- Exact active SDE/SDevice code is not publicly synced, so implementation pending obtaining originals. No simulation result yet.

## 2026-10-08 — First Node 6 QW local Probe observations (not emission validation complete)

- 이택규 SVisual screenshots from `n6_inter_0004_des`: `Clean_QW1`–`Clean_QW4` are confirmed InGaN zones. Selected field is horizontally clipped (`...bination`); tentatively `RadiativeRecombination`, pending fully visible name confirmation.
- Local values [cm^-3 s^-1 if radiative]: QW1 5.531972320698e12, QW2 9.346620224854e14, QW3 4.188264170176e13, QW4 6.069760269935e14.
- Positive point values cannot prove total QW emission, normal LED operating current or IQE. Continue active-material radiative parameter + actual QW volume/area integration + e/h and terminal-current checks before accepting normal LED baseline.

## 2026-10-08 — Half-domain / injection sanity review (not an approved baseline change)

- 작업자: 이택규 / Claude proposal reviewed by ChatGPT; 상태: REVIEWED / PROPOSED.
- Baseline Node6 at 4.7128 V has I=2.8954e-12 A/um; under nominal 4 um lateral area, J≈7.24e-5 A/cm2. Arithmetic matches SDevice T-2022.03 2D-current convention, but low injection and high-bias IV require physical sanity check; no assertion of LED failure until terminal current composition, live input/contacts and existing TDR band/current/recombination are verified.
- Half-domain has conditional symmetry rationale and may reduce degrees of freedom, but is NOT yet implemented or validated; current full/fine FAST_C1 remains reference. Do not co-change mesh and domain without isolating effects.
- RhsMin L2 sqrt(2) argument is a model-dependent hypothesis; changing convergence threshold needs separate validation, not automatic adoption.
- Existing A/B GO/NO-GO gates remain. Reference: LIVE LOG Issue #7 review dated 2026-10-08.

## 2026-10-07 — Project A/B production pre-run GO/NO-GO audit

- 작업자: 주수빈
- 상태: REVIEWED / TEAM GATE
- FAST_C1/Common Baseline은 Project A/B의 parent로 사용 가능하며 physical baseline을 다시 만드는 것은 불필요.
- 하지만 multi-day A/B production sweep은 즉시 시작하지 않기로 함.
- 시작 전 필수: 실제 active preprocessed deck 확인, 모든 spatial output 및 region-integral extraction 선검증, 2D current-density normalization, A/B parameterized geometry+mesh+null controls, Save/Load smoke, 대표 pilot.
- A는 same-material GaN Cedge 내부 경계에 명시적 mesh refinement가 필요.
- B는 AlBarrier의 exact vertical span을 먼저 확정해야 하며, QW edge를 치환하는 경우 active QW volume 변화가 comparison metric에 반영되어야 함.
- 상세 기준: `CMP/PROJECT_AB_PRE_RUN_AUDIT.md`.

## 2026-10-06 — Claude high-bias runtime analysis reviewed; FAST_C2 proposed

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: REVIEWED / PROPOSED / NOT EXECUTED
- Claude package `FAST_C2_strategy_for_GPT.zip` reviewed by ChatGPT.
- central diagnosis accepted as a working numerical model:
  - high-bias runtime is dominated by a local convergent-timestep ceiling (`dt*`) plus `Increment=1.2` growth -> expensive rejection -> ~0.5 cutback cycling.
  - Node 6 representative failure: dt=1.1842e-5, RHS ~1.41e-3 stagnates through Iteration 15; retry dt=5.9211e-6 converges in 2 iterations.
  - idealized cycle model reproduces current Node 6 speed (~2.24 mV/h model vs ~2.2 mV/h observed).
  - under the same idealized assumptions, Increment=1.05 + Iterations=8 gives ~5.24 mV/h; this is a model prediction, not measured C2 performance.
- FAST_C2 remains numerical-only PROPOSED:
  - staged global-time Transient
  - 4 V+ Increment 1.05
  - candidate Iterations 8 subject to D2 accepted-iteration audit
  - checkpoints at 4.0/4.4/4.6/4.8 V
  - RHSMin/physics/mesh/5 V endpoint unchanged
- important ChatGPT caveat:
  - changing iteration cap/timestep growth changes the transient step sequence; identical convergence criteria do not by themselves guarantee identical trap/transient state.
  - NtSide=1e18 C2 validation must include trap charge/occupancy, SRH, radiative/Auger and carrier distributions, not I-V alone.
  - Claude trap-emission estimate uses generic GaN assumptions and is not a confirmed active-deck timescale.
- current Node 6/12 runs MUST continue as reference evidence.
- syntax/manual gates remain unresolved: segmented InitialTime/FinalTime+Goal semantics, Save/Load syntax, and whether existing Plot(-Loadable) TDR can be loaded.
- Decision 0 is separate and pending team approval: whether production analysis endpoint may be defined by a validated current-density window instead of always requiring 5 V. Baseline 5 V endpoint is not changed.
- `iv_window.py` J values are provisional until AreaFactor/2D current normalization is verified.
- public files added:
  - `CMP/FAST_BASELINE_C2.md`
  - `CMP/tcad/tools/make_restart_deck.py`
  - `CMP/tcad/tools/iv_window.py`
- proprietary full C2 deck was NOT uploaded; recorded production deck SHA-256 = `b876f614424202e6deaf0655411d7bc15733095da297c1df9ca5ebaacbb578d1`.
- helper scripts passed Python syntax and synthetic-only tests; no live Sentaurus test yet.
- next: D1–D6 in order, then C2 smoke gate before any production C2 run.

## 2026-10-04 — B0 cutback-rule validation CLOSED

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED / B0 COMPLETE
- regenerated x8 CSV with the updated audit tool using explicit `Stepsize`.
- all 285 rejection/retry pairs were checked.
- `retry_dt / rejected_dt`:
  - pairs = 285
  - min = 0.499975805
  - max = 0.500023337
  - mean = 0.499999621
- interpretation: the retry timestep is effectively exactly 0.5 of the rejected timestep; remaining spread is consistent with printed Stepsize precision.
- this closes the B0 assumption that the transient cutback factor is independent of whether the rejected Newton attempt ran to 50 or is capped at 15.
- therefore C1 should preserve the x8 rejection points/accepted-step trajectory over the observed overlap; only the rejected-attempt Newton count changes 50 -> 15.
- C1 source remains unchanged: SHA-256 `f62eab51816ba21a9fba6f9d26ef39606ea76b17c2a522153d4b45ed8cf27f93`, `Iterations=15`.
- next: separate FAST C1 Workbench project/copy -> source hash -> preprocess gate.
- live x6/x7/x8 untouched.

## 2026-10-04 — FAST C1 B0 review strengthened acceptance criteria

- **작업자:** 이택규
- **구현/검토:** Claude B0 review + ChatGPT verification
- **상태:** PROPOSED / READY FOR SEPARATE PREPROCESS
- C1 source remains `Iterations=15`; no physics/source change beyond the already-reviewed numerical cap.
- ~4.33 V interpretation corrected: first rejected attempt with changed Newton count, not trajectory divergence.
- A1'/A1'' added: preserve accepted/rejection trajectory over overlap and require C1 rejection message to show 15-cap.
- full CSV cutback-ratio constancy remains pending; observed examples are ~0.5.
- live x6/x7/x8 remain untouched.

## 2026-10-04 — FAST_BASELINE C1 selected as first numerical candidate (PROPOSED)

- **작업자:** 이택규
- **구현:** Claude / **검토:** ChatGPT
- **상태:** PROPOSED / REVIEWED / NOT EXECUTED
- Copy x8 golden 대비 유일한 executable change는 forward Transient inner Coupled `Iterations=15`.
- Common Baseline physics/traps/geometry/step controls는 유지.
- Synopsys 2022 training의 15–20 iteration 권고와 방향은 일치하지만, 프로젝트의 ~50-iteration failure 기록과 documented default 20 사이 불일치가 있어 B0 raw-log audit이 선행되어야 함.
- 최종 FAST 채택 전에는 numerical/physical equivalence + runtime 모두 검증.
- live x6/x7/x8은 보존.

## 2026-09-28 — Final SDevice v1.2 source-sync gap 발견

- **작성자:** ChatGPT
- **참여자:** 이택규 / 주수빈
- **구분:** 공용 동기화 점검
- **상태:** OBSERVED + UNRESOLVED
- **내용:** JuSubin의 Issue #7 및 개인 타임라인에는 Final SDevice v1.2 수정 이력이 기록되어 있으나, 실제 `CMP/tcad/CURRENT/sdevice2_defect_on.cmd`는 오래된 버전으로 남아 있어 최신 실행 코드와 GitHub source-of-truth가 불일치함.

새로운 의미 있는 작업이 생기면 최신 기록을 위쪽에 추가한다.


## 2026-10-09 11:30 KST — JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB completion reported

- 작업자: 이택규
- 상태: OBSERVED (user report; terminal/log not yet re-verified in this session)
- 이택규가 주수빈이 전날 실행한 `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB`가 모두 완료되었다고 보고함.
- 이 보고로 Half+coarse transient branch는 "running"에서 "completion reported" 상태로 이동.
- 단, 최종 bias 도달, fatal/error 부재, 산출물 존재, elapsed time, I-V/IQE 유효성은 아직 로그로 재확인하지 않았으므로 CONFIRMED로 승격하지 않음.
- 다음: project terminal에서 n2_des.log/out/err와 최종 .plt/.tdr 존재를 확인하고, final 0.3 V 도달/normal termination/accepted final step을 검증. 그 후 QS Copy 결과와 runtime·I-V를 비교하고 full FAST_C1 reference 대비 half+coarse validation을 진행.


## 2026-10-09 — Transient pass, QS Copy MinStep stop
- User-provided logs: JuSubin half+coarse original transient completed to anode 0.3V (25019.43 s), I-V file exists.
- Distinct QS Copy ended because `Step-size less than MinStep (8.3986e-07)` after 18417.09 s; result save/normal program exit does not prove sweep completion. Final accepted voltage and failure mechanism pending.
- Team action: diagnose QS plot/log before solver alterations; full/fine reference equivalence pending.


## 2026-10-09 — QS Copy last accepted bias determined
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from user-provided `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB_Copy/n2_des.plt` tail and `n2_des.log` grep.
- Last recorded QS pseudo-time: 6.43487876313307E-02; last anode OuterVoltage: 1.93046362893992E-02 V (0.0193046363 V; 19.3 mV, only ~6.435% of requested 0.3 V).
- Last log attempts at t=0.0643488 to 0.0643505 then terminated `Step-size less than MinStep (step-size = 8.3986e-07)`.
- QS runtime 18417.09 s but did NOT reach goal. Cannot compare as speedup to original transient that reached 0.3 V in 25019.43 s.
- Root numerical/physics trigger not yet established. Next: inspect QS log around lines 6900-7000 and `n2_des.err`; no blind MinStep or baseline modification.


## 2026-10-09 — Original transient vs QS Copy settings compared
- 작업자: 이택규; 상태: OBSERVED from user-shared original `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/pp2_des.cmd` grep and previous QS Copy preprocessed deck.
- Both original transient and QS Copy: `ErrRef(electron/hole)=1e4`, `RHSMin=1e-3`, `CheckRhsAfterUpdate`, startup Poisson `Coupled(Iterations=500, LineSearchDamping=1e-2)`, startup carrier `Coupled(Iterations=100)`, sweep inner `Coupled(Iterations=15)` without explicit sweep-local damping.
- Original transient: `Transient` with InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2 (actual final 0.3V result was confirmed earlier). QS Copy: `Quasistationary` InitialStep=0.03, MinStep=1e-6, MaxStep=0.15, Increment=1.5, Decrement=2.0, Goal(anode)=0.3V. Time coordinates have different meanings and cannot be compared directly as numerical step sizes.
- Correction: lack of explicit sweep-local LineSearchDamping is NOT a unique QS setting and cannot by itself explain the divergent convergence. Underlying cause still UNRESOLVED. Other Physics settings and actual complete original Goal/Decrement block not yet side-by-side audited.
- The original source header comments say 0-4.0V/4.0-5.0V, whereas current observed result was a 0.3V smoke; must read executable original Goal in `pp2_des.cmd` to resolve the potentially stale header comment.
- Next: inspect original `pp2_des.cmd` lines 583–615 for actual executable voltage Goal and step-control; preserve both results and Common Baseline. No code changes.


## 2026-10-09 — Original transient executable Goal confirmed (smoke only)
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from user terminal `../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB/pp2_des.cmd` lines 580–615 (actual executable block): `Transient(InitialTime=0.0, FinalTime=0.06, InitialStep=1e-5, MinStep=1e-9, MaxStep=1e-3, Increment=1.2, Goal{Name="anode", Voltage=0.3})` and inner `Coupled(Iterations=15){Poisson Electron Hole}`, followed by `Save(FilePrefix="n2_smoke_ckpt_0p3V")`.
- Therefore full 0.3 V endpoint was explicitly intended for this short syntax/mesh/physics smoke; earlier header comments describing 0–4.0 V/4.0–5.0 V are NOT the executable sweep configuration for Node 2. Previous comment/Goal discrepancy resolved.
- Original Transient smoke successfully finished 0.3 V; does not establish 3–5 V forward I–V, IQE or half+coarse equivalence to full/fine reference. QS Copy stalled at 0.019304636 V and remains an experimental numerical branch.
- Decision: preserve both existing projects and all outputs; prioritize preparing a separate, reviewed high-bias Transient branch for actual LED operation, only after source/provenance, bias plan, solver stability and half-vs-full validation gates. Do NOT modify original 0.3 V smoke or automatically launch 5 V.


## 2026-10-09 — Half 5V test SDevice edit performed in copied SWB project
- 작업자: 이택규. OBSERVED from terminal in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: user ran `cp -p sdevice_des.cmd sdevice_des_0p3V_backup.cmd`, then `sed -i` replacing `FinalTime = 0.06` with `1.0`, `Goal Voltage = 0.3` with `5.0`, and `Save FilePrefix n@node@_smoke_ckpt_0p3V` with `n@node@_5V_ckpt`.
- Follow-up `grep -nE 'FinalTime|Voltage =|FilePrefix =' sdevice_des.cmd` confirmed line 587 FinalTime=1.0, line 597 Goal Voltage=5.0, line 608 new 5V Save prefix; initial electrode Voltage=0.0 appears at lines 38 and 43.
- Code modification is OBSERVED in the user's remote copied project, NOT yet synced as full source to GitHub. Backup command executed but exact backup-byte equality not independently checked. Original `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB` and QS Copy were not targeted.
- Numerical intent: preserve the old 5 V per time-unit voltage ramp by adjusting 0.3/0.06 to 5/1; note `Transient` time is physical simulation time and this is not a steady-state QS. Not yet validated for high-bias convergence/current/IQE. The old 0.3V smoke comment in source may remain stale.
- NEXT: in the copied SWB project select SDevice Node 2 and run Ctrl+P preprocessing only; check generated `pp2_des.cmd` for actual FinalTime=1.0, anode Goal Voltage=5.0, Save prefix and expected mesh/physics/NtSide before F7. Do NOT run 5V yet; check that copied project prep is independent from original.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V copied Half/Coarse transient backup and Grid/Trap preflight observed
- 작업자: 이택규; 상태: OBSERVED from user's terminal (archive integrity check pending; 5V run NOT YET observed).
- At `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject`, user executed `tar -czf JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST_pre5V_20261009.tar.gz JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`; `ls -lh` confirms archive 12M, timestamp Oct 9 11:25. This is an existing compressed project snapshot made *after* 5V source edits, containing copied old 0.3V outputs; not a verified successful 5V result. Archive contents/integrity have not yet been independently checked with `tar -tzf`.
- In copied project `pp2_des.cmd` grep: Grid=`n1_msh.tdr` line20; 12 displayed region-level `Conc=0` lines145–365; RHSMin=1e-3 line510; startup Coupled Iterations=500 and 100; sweep `Coupled(Iterations=15)` line600. Earlier pp2 verification showed executable Transient, FinalTime=1.0, Goal anode=5.0, Save prefix `n2_5V_ckpt`.
- Original 0.3V smoke and separate QS Copy preserved. Current blocker: archive integrity check and launching SDevice Node2 only in copied SWB; don't launch SDE or modify original. 5V high-bias numerical/physical validity, IQE, I-V, mesh/symmetry equivalence are not established. Allow initial run only as exploratory independent branch, with output/log monitoring and no runtime/accuracy promise.
- NEXT: `tar -tzf ../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST_pre5V_20261009.tar.gz > /dev/null` and `echo $status` (C-shell-compatible; 0 expected); then copied SWB Node2 SDevice Run F7 only; inspect new n2_des.log/err after startup, verify no immediate failure and logs no longer Oct 9 01:39 copied outputs.


## 2026-10-09 — 5V copied project Node2 not running; old 0.3V log confirmed
- 작업자: 이택규; OBSERVED user terminal from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`.
- `ps -fu semi437 | grep '[s]device'` showed ONLY two old active sdevice processes: PID 69457 running `pp6_des.cmd` since Oct04, and PID 93915 running `pp12_des.cmd` since Oct06 (both 99% CPU). No `pp2_des.cmd` SDevice process present in this observed process list. A queued SWB job, if any, was not separately checked.
- `n2_des.log` mtime Oct 9 01:39:13 +0900; its tail says the *old original 0.3V smoke* completed with `Good Bye` Oct9 01:39:13, wallclock 25019.43 s and 2.61GB peak memory. This log was inherited by directory copy and is NOT a 5V result.
- Therefore no indication 5V SDevice Node2 has launched; do NOT Clean Up Node merely to start. Existing pre5V archive readable (tar listing status 0), pp2_des.cmd preprocessed 5V parameters confirmed earlier.
- NEXT: if concurrent machine/license resources are acceptable, select **only** SDevice Node2 in the SWB copied `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` and run F7. Avoid SDE re-run. Monitor fresh `n2_des.log` timestamp and View Output; check convergence and actual attained anode voltage. CPU contention from pp6/pp12 may prolong 5V run. Do not mark 5V started/completed before evidence.

## 2026-10-09 — 이택규 Half+Coarse 5V_TEST 5V 달성 (OBSERVED)

- OBSERVED source: user-provided terminal in `/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, `tail -n 40 n2_des.log` after run. Final anode voltage `5.000E+00 V`, anode electron `2.781E-13`, hole `1.420E-11`, total current `1.448E-11` (terminal output units require current-normalization audit). `Finished, because... Curve trace finished.`, `Sentaurus Device simulation finished`, `Good Bye !` at 2026-10-09 14:29:52 KST.
- OBSERVED files written per log: `n2_5V_ckpt_des.sav`, `n2_5V_ckpt_circuit_des.sav`, `n2_des.tdr`. `wallclock=10596.76 s` (2 h 56 m 36.76 s), total CPU 30641.23 s, peak memory 2.97 GB. `ps` showed only pp6 PID 69457 and pp12 PID 93915; no active pp2 at check.
- Proven: copied **Half+Coarse NtSide=0** Transient Node2 reached 5V and terminated normally. Not proven: publication-grade/common damaged NtSide=1e18 baseline, physical I-V/current-density validity, full-vs-half equivalence, IQE/optical emission, extracted current units, or A/B improvements. Do not treat save filename alone as 5V evidence; here independently supported by final 5V terminal row + normal curve trace.
- Previous 116h extrapolated runtime and 3–7+day planning range are superseded by the **measured 10596.76 s** for this run; reason for fast runtime relative to old 0.3V smoke remains unverified. Do not infer speedup or solver equivalence without source/deck/log comparison.
- NEXT: preserve 5V outputs/checkpoints and current reference pp6/pp12 jobs; inspect `n2_des.plt` for full I-V, ensure actual postprocess unit/AreaFactor/2D symmetry normalization, compare intermediate MQW Rrad/SRH/Auger and carrier/injection with full/fine at matched bias/current; then separate nominal `NtSide=1e18` damage case after controlled preprocess/short-run gate. Project A/B production remains NO-GO pending existing audit.

## 2026-10-09 — Half+Coarse 5V_TEST PLT 1023-point I–V readout and Parameters path confirmed (OBSERVED)

- 작업자: 이택규. User ran read-only awk across `n2_des.plt` DF-ISE Data with 17 fields per record: `ROWS=1023`, `REMAINDER=0`, first anode OuterVoltage 0 V, last exactly 5.00000000000000E+00 V; last anode TotalCurrent (raw printed) 1.44801646079583E-11. This confirms a fully parsed 17-column series from 0 to 5V but not yet its physical current units or validity.
- Sampled voltage/raw total current pairs: (0 V, -9.34556980161972E-27), (0.503368865 V, 5.81275673304787E-15), (1.003368865 V, 6.13100514338505E-15), (1.503368865 V, 7.84214693612489E-15), (2.003368865 V, 1.31567117783539E-14), (2.503368865 V, 2.84645414227297E-14), (3.003368865 V, 3.17582117791696E-14), (3.503368865 V, 3.28516927136479E-14), (4.003368865 V, 3.50552134304176E-14), (4.503368865 V, 3.69335070901735E-13), (5V, 1.44801646079583E-11). Sample points show pronounced rise above ~4V, not evidence of confirmed LED emission or normal operating current; full 1023-point monotonicity not checked.
- `pp2_des.cmd` File block points to `Grid="n1_msh.tdr"`, `Parameters="FASTC1_pp6_des.par"`, `Plot="n2_des.tdr"`, `Current="n2_des.plt"`, `Output="n2_des.log"`. User `find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.par'` returned `./FASTC1_pp6_des.par`. Therefore absent `pp2_des.par` is explained by correct alternate parameter filename. Parameter *contents*, AreaFactor absence across all active sources, radiative coefficient and steady-state-vs-transient interpretation not yet verified.
- Source header comments claim staged 0–4 / 4–5V with multiple checkpoint saves, but previous actual executable Solve was a single 0–5V transient and log showed end Save only; comments cannot substitute for active code. Do not assert multi-stage operation from comments.
- NEXT: read-only inspect `FASTC1_pp6_des.par`, actual `pp2_des.cmd` Physics/Plot and any AreaFactor; establish semiconductor radiative coefficient/output fields, 2D width and current scaling; then evaluate MQW Rrad/SRH/Auger and terminal carrier-current consistency using `n2_des.tdr`. Do not modify working code, clean up, or rerun as part of audit. NtSide=0 endpoint success does not validate damaged NtSide=1e18 or final common baseline.

## 2026-10-09 — Half+Coarse 5V endpoint contact-current components and recombination declarations (OBSERVED / emission UNRESOLVED)

- 작업자: 이택규. User provided direct terminal outputs from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`: last DF-ISE PLT record `time=1.00000000000000E+00, V=5.00000000000000E+00`. Anode raw `DisplacementCurrent=3.29132361382365E-18`, `eCurrent=2.78143237811134E-13`, `hCurrent=1.42020180788235E-11`, `TotalCurrent=1.44801646079583E-11`. At final step, terminal displacement contribution is negligible relative to total; anode hole current dominates. This does NOT establish MQW hole injection or steady-state across complete device.
- Actual parameter linkage confirmed: `pp2_des.cmd` uses `Parameters="FASTC1_pp6_des.par"` and `find` locates that exact file. User `cat FASTC1_pp6_des.par` shows only `LatticeParameters`, `Thermionic Formula=1`, and GaN Mg active-species `Ionization`; **no explicit Radiative coefficient in this parameter file**. Material database / other effective settings may still supply parameters: do not infer radiative coefficient=0 from this absence.
- User `grep -niE 'AreaFactor|Radiative|SRH|Auger|Recombination|CurrentPlot' pp2_des.cmd FASTC1_pp6_des.par` shows SDevice Physics `Recombination(SRH(), Auger(), Radiative)` at pp2 lines ~78–84, and Plot datasets `SRHRecombination`, `RadiativeRecombination`, `AugerRecombination` ~398–408. No AreaFactor match in these two files. These are code/model/output declarations, **not proof that any MQW Rrad is positive, integrated, or emitted light**.
- Prior Synopsys T-2022.03 UG audit recorded in `LeeTaekGyu/TIMELINE.md` (2026-10-08; Device UG §16 pp.488–489) cautions non-GaAs radiative-coefficient default may be zero without override; need verify effective GaN/InGaN material coefficients instead of claiming emission. Material database not reviewed in this turn.
- Next: read-only inspect `pp2_des.cmd` Physics/Plot context and `n2_des.log` radiative/material parameter clues, then open final `n2_des.tdr` in SVisual and confirm fully visible `RadiativeRecombination` values inside `Clean_QW1`–`Clean_QW4`; compare SRH/Auger and carrier maps and, when validated, perform spatial integration. Current-density normalization/AreaFactor still unresolved; no code modified, no rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V Half+Coarse SVisual RadiativeRecombination field visible, QW attribution pending (OBSERVED)

- 작업자: 이택규. User shared Sentaurus Visual T-2022.03 screenshot, project title `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`, data `n2_des`, selected scalar `RadiativeRecombination` (not only an output-deck declaration). Colorbar displays max `7.483e+19 cm^-3*s^-1` and minimum `-7.512e-34 cm^-3*s^-1` (numerically ~0). Therefore the **displayed spatial field includes nonzero positive radiative recombination** at the plotted state. Note values are 3D volume-rate density and do not imply integrated photon rate or EQE.
- Spatial map shows high rate in several thin **top** layers and near-zero deep bulk. Individual colored layers are not yet labelled as Clean_QW1–Clean_QW4. Screenshot top Data Selection was `Lines/Particles`, not a visible region-isolation of each InGaN QW. Hence precise QW rate, total QW-integrated radiative recombination, meaningful LED optical emission, efficiency/IQE, material coefficient C, and carrier balance are **not yet verified**.
- Bottom status: `Elements=138194`, `Points=65513`, consistent with accelerated Half+Coarse SDE mesh provenance. The screenshot is direct evidence for field visualization, not a quantitative integration of MQWs or a comparison against reference Full/fine.
- NEXT: in SVisual, open `Regions` tab and identify/visually isolate `Clean_QW1`–`Clean_QW4` while keeping RadiativeRecombination selected; zoom near top quantum-well stack, verify region names and use Probe to obtain numerical QW values. After check, inspect SRH/Auger spatial distributions and integrated rates. Preserve current saved data/other active jobs; do not launch new run. Material radiative coefficient and 2D current normalization remain unresolved.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V_TEST four InGaN Clean_QW local RadiativeRecombination Probe measurements (OBSERVED; IQE NOT YET)

- 작업자: 이택규. User supplied four direct Sentaurus Visual Probe screenshots in `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` / `n2_des`, with scalar `RadiativeRecombination`, explicit zone label, x/y coordinates and Magnitude (cm^-3 s^-1, unit grounded in preceding SVisual legend).
- `Clean_QW1(InGaN)`: x=0.169818746552, y=0.560459877538, z=0, `Rrad=1.836010164996e+13`.
- `Clean_QW2(InGaN)`: x=0.194326754006, y=0.556958733616, z=0, `Rrad=3.558921779790e+12`.
- `Clean_QW3(InGaN)`: x=0.22058533342, y=0.56571159342, z=0, `Rrad=8.395713573050e+14`.
- `Clean_QW4(InGaN)`: x=0.245093340874, y=0.58321731303, z=0, `Rrad=7.094266327897e+18`.
- Result: **each of four named InGaN QWs contains a positive local Rrad point**, beyond mere output declaration or plot-wide maximum. The QW4 sampled point exceeds sampled other QW values by several orders of magnitude. HOWEVER: points differ in both vertical and lateral coordinates (x/y), so local values are **NOT** region-integrated emission, per-well averages or a verified QW4 total-emission dominance. Do not treat local peak, photon escape, IQE or material radiative coefficient as validated.
- Remaining: check SRH and Auger at the *same probe coordinates*, map Rrad spatially through each QW and perform mesh/region correct integrals, confirm 2D current normalization, injection/current plausibility and half-vs-full correspondence; NtSide=0 branch only. No new solver or source changes.

## 2026-10-09: 이택규 5V_TEST Clean_QW4 같은 좌표 Probe. x=0.244864017914, y=0.651958341615, z=0, InGaN. Radiative 7.103015017104e18, SRH 1.681575471039e22, Auger 1.238545872618e15, Total 1.682285896396e22 (cm^-3 s^-1). Local radiative fraction about 0.0422%; NOT integrated IQE. Verify physical rates and lifetimes before baseline freeze; no code change.

## 2026-10-09 — Project A fabrication-route feasibility brainstorm (PROPOSED / NOT APPROVED / NOT RUN)

- Worker: 이택규. Request: evaluate how the Stage1 Project A localized upper-nGaN-sidewall GaN:C Cedge could be fabricated. **No process route selected, no implantation/epitaxy performed, no TCAD/SProcess code modified.** Original frozen Common Baseline, Cedge conceptual position inside existing 5nm damaged-sidewall strip under MQW, and NtSide0/1e18 comparison remain unchanged.
- Candidate POST-MESA: completed LED epitaxy → ICP mesa etch exposes nGaN sidewall → protect pGaN/MQW and all non-target surfaces with *selective vertical-height mask/spacer* → angled/rotated C-ion implantation into exposed upper-nGaN sidewall → damage-recovery/thermal-budget gate → passivation and contacts. Critical unsolved gates: selectively exposing only target nGaN sidewall without irradiating QWs; finite ion straggle/depth/dose, angular shadowing; implanted C electrical activity vs implantation-induced isolation; post-MQW anneal thermal damage risk. Without selective mask this does **not** implement the current localized nGaN-only Cedge.
- Candidate PRE-MQW: grow nGaN up to intended upper region → lithographically mask future mesa-edge ring → implant C into exposed nGaN or grow selective GaN:C → validated recovery/cleaning and epitaxial regrowth → deposit MQW/EBL/pGaN → accurately align future mesa etch to buried annulus → passivation/contact. Protects already-formed MQW from carbon implantation anneal (since it is grown later) but has severe future-mesa overlay, high-quality epitaxial regrowth, and implant-damage recovery gates. Exact 5nm Dmg in TCAD is **not** a realizable lithographic alignment tolerance specification.
- Literature DOES demonstrate related *non-carbon* isolation concepts: As sidewall implantation in InGaN microLED (Next Nanotechnology 2025 DOI 10.1016/j.nxnano.2024.100101), F-implanted p-GaN current confinement ring in 6-10um microLED (ACS Photonics 2026 DOI 10.1021/acsphotonics.5c02363). Neither verifies a C-implanted upper-nGaN sidewall ring. Earlier `Characterization of Ca and C implanted GaN` (Materials Science and Engineering B 1997 DOI 10.1016/S0921-5107(97)00144-X) documents implantation damage/incomplete anneal with C+, and a Sandia 1995 report `Role of C, O and H in III-V nitrides` reports no measurable electrical activity for implanted C under its investigated conditions. Carbon-doped GaN growth literature supports C_N deep acceptor around Ev+0.9–1.1eV, but implanted-carbon activity cannot be assumed to match as-grown GaN:C.
- InGaN MQWs have temperature-dependent degradation/intermixing sensitivity; reports show significant degradation around 930–950 C for particular structures (J Alloys Compounds 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.163519; J Crystal Growth 2005 DOI 10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.04.002). Do not establish a universal safe/unsafe anneal temperature or prescribe unverified implantation energy/dose/angle/temperature.
- Next research gates: 1) team decides whether target is a chemically active C_N-compensated GaN:C edge vs damage-based implantation isolation (different device physics!); 2) compare POST vs PRE-MQW process feasibility, alignment and thermal budgets; 3) obtain measured/proven C depth and lateral profile/activation data, SRIM/SProcess process profile model before claiming fabrication realism; 4) ensure experimental masked/annealed control and inert-ion damage controls to separate C compensation vs irradiation damage; 5) keep current Baseline electrical/radiative validation priority unchanged.

## 2026-10-09 — 5V SVisual Clean_QW3 Rad field integral and '+' label correction (OBSERVED / UNRESOLVED)

- Worker 이택규 supplied `Field Integration` screenshot for `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`: field `RadiativeRecombination`, right pane `Regions of Dimension 2` shows ONLY `Clean_QW3 (InGaN)` with `Integral = 2.657110e+02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=5.985012e-03 [um^2]`. This is **Clean_QW3-only 2D area integral**, not full QW3 or total photon output, and NOT IQE. Left list highlights both `Clean_QW3` and `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` but only Clean_QW3 appears in right output, possibly stale result until Start Integration; do not interpret highlighted items as proven integrated.
- **Correction of previous GPT claim:** `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` should NOT be assumed to denote union of bulk regions or selected as sole full-well ROI. Its structure and lack of inclusion in the dimension-2 output indicate it is likely a lower-dimensional boundary/interface label. Exact T-2022.03 metadata for '+' label has not been independently inspected, so interface interpretation remains PROVISIONAL. Safest method: select standalone region `DmgL_QW3` (not '+' named item), click `Start Integration`, verify `Regions of Dimension 2: DmgL_QW3`, record its Integral/Domain, then **sum independent Clean_QW3 and DmgL_QW3** integrals for whole QW3 (or choose both standalone 2D regions and verify both appear in output). Do not double-count interface or mix old results.
- The physical measured rate is 2D area-integrated per out-of-plane unit; raw SVisual [s^-1 um^-1] is NOT absolute 3D photon rate without explicit effective thickness. Same geometric normalization cancels for recombination fraction ratios when all wells are treated consistently; continue SRH/Auger over same 2D set and four QWs before IQE.
- Source: user screenshot Oct9 and earlier GitHub `PROJECT_AB_PRE_RUN_AUDIT.md`, SVisual manual Integration Tool general region-filter procedure. No code or TCAD source modified, no new run.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 full 2D Radiative integration obtained from separate Clean/Dmg regions (OBSERVED)

- Worker 이택규; user SVisual Field Integration screenshot of completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`, field `RadiativeRecombination`, `Regions of Dimension 2` explicitly lists **DmgL_QW3 (InGaN)**: `Integral=5.268180e-01 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=1.500002e-05 [um^2]`.
- Previously directly observed **Clean_QW3 (InGaN)**: `Integral=2.657110e+02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=5.985012e-03 [um^2]`.
- These are separate disjoint **2D area region** integrals, so the full QW3 half-device measured raw regional sum = **266.237818 s^-1 um^-1**; total measured 2D domain area = **0.00600001202 um^2**. Arithmetic: 265.711 + 0.526818; 0.005985012 + 0.00001500002. **Derived**, not direct SVisual combined group output.
- This supersedes earlier incorrect idea that '+' item is a merged area. The `Clean_QW3+DmgL_QW3` entry should not be used as integrated 2D union without proof (likely lower-dimensional interface). Not full device IQE/absolute 3D photon rate. At NtSide=0, parametric damaged-edge traps are off, while DmgL_QW3 geometry exists.
- NEXT READ-ONLY: Integrate `srhRecombination` for standalone Clean_QW3 and DmgL_QW3 (or both as explicitly distinct 2D regions with actual Total Integral verification), then `AugerRecombination` same region scope. Keep units and voltage fixed; after all four QWs, compute recombination-based IQE from summed Rrad/SRH/Auger integrals; confirm normalization, full-vs-half equivalence and current physics before declaring baseline.
- No TCAD source edit, no new run; original files and checkpoints retained.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 DmgL Auger spatial integral measured (OBSERVED)

- 이택규 supplied direct SVisual Field Integration screenshot for completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`: `AugerRecombination` `Regions of Dimension 2: DmgL_QW3 (InGaN)`; `Integral=5.774334e-02 [s^-1*um^-1]`, `Domain=1.500002e-05 [um^2]`.
- Prior directly observed same-region 2D Radiative `0.526818`, SRH `1655.249` [s^-1 um^-1] and same Domain. Therefore DmgL_QW3 has all 3 regional integrals and SRH dominates *this segment*. At `NtSide=0`, generic SRH remains active; do NOT attribute to parameterized edge traps or infer full QW/device IQE.
- The earlier request was `Clean_QW3` SRH; user instead measured DmgL_QW3 Auger, which is useful and preserved. Still missing standalone `Clean_QW3` SRH and Auger for full QW3 radiative-vs-nonradiative integration. Clean_QW3 Radiative=265.711 [s^-1 um^-1]. NEXT: switch field `srhRecombination` + select only standalone `Clean_QW3` + Start Integration, screenshot. Then `AugerRecombination` + standalone `Clean_QW3`, repeat. No code edits or rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — QW3 whole-well 2D recombination integrals and derived recombination fraction (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- Worker: 이택규. User screenshots of Sentaurus Visual Field Integration from successful 5V `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des`. Newly OBSERVED `Clean_QW3(InGaN)`, Region of Dimension 2: `srhRecombination Integral=5.841611e+05 [s^-1 um^-1]` and `AugerRecombination Integral=1.265704e+01 [s^-1 um^-1]`; both Domain `5.985012e-03 um^2`. Earlier standalone Clean_QW3 Rrad=265.711; DmgL_QW3 Rrad=0.526818, SRH=1655.249, Auger=0.05774334 [s^-1 um^-1], Dmg Domain=1.500002e-05 um^2.
- Independent nonoverlapping **Half-domain QW3 Clean+DmgL** 2D area integral sums [s^-1 um^-1]: Rrad=**266.237818**; SRH=**585816.349**; Auger=**12.71478334**; sum all 3=**586095.30160134**. Derived recombination-based **QW3-only, 5V, NtSide=0 ratio** = 100*266.237818/586095.30160134 = **0.0454256871%**. SRH fraction ≈99.9524049%, Auger fraction≈0.0021694054%.
- Fraction of QW3 SRH integral from Clean region = 584161.1/585816.349 ≈99.71745%; DmgL contribution ~0.28255%. This matters for Project A sidewall-loss hypothesis: high QW3 SRH is not dominated by Dmg region under NtSide=0 in this output. It does NOT diagnose causes; Clean area is also ~99.75% of total QW3 physical cross-section. Generic SRH remains active even when NtSide=0. Need verify effective SRH lifetimes, material radiative coefficients, carrier density, local recombination maps and current normalization before claiming physical LED model is valid.
- **Strict scope**: QW3 recombination-ratio from spatial integrals, NOT whole-MQW/device IQE, EQE, measured experimental light, or proof that damaged NtSide=1e18 device behaves similarly. 2D integrals are per out-of-plane micrometer per SVisual display, common thickness factors cancel in within-device ratios. Full/fine vs Half/coarse and mesh convergence still unverified.
- NEXT: integrate Rrad/SRH/Auger in standalone Clean_QW1 + DmgL_QW1, QW2, QW4; record Region Dimension 2/Domain and compute 4-QW summed IQE. In parallel physical parameter and J-normalization audit; no modifications/re-run now.

## 2026-10-09 — 이택규 QW4 Clean+DmgL 2D integrals obtained (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- 5V_TEST NtSide=0 Half. SVisual Clean_QW4 2D integrals [s^-1 um^-1]: Rad 38746.96, SRH 35617690, Auger 1327.983, Domain 0.005985012 um². DmgL_QW4: Rad 98.768, SRH 226496.2, Auger 2.414354, Domain 0.00001500002 um². Summed QW4 Rrad 38845.728, SRH 35844186.2, Auger 1330.397354, total 35884362.325354. QW4-only recombination radiative fraction 0.1082525242%; SRH 99.8880400%. Prior QW3-only radiative fraction 0.0454256871%.
- This is NOT device IQE/EQE, and strong SRH requires effective material physics and current/injection sanity checks. QW1 and QW2 integrations pending. No source/run modifications.

## 2026-10-09 — QW2 complete 2D Clean/DmgL radiative, SRH, Auger integrals + active physics grep (OBSERVED / DERIVED)

- Worker 이택규 shared six Sentaurus Visual T-2022.03 Field Integration screenshots from the completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/n2_des` dataset at 5V, NtSide=0, Half+Coarse. Right pane confirms Regions of Dimension 2 for every selected independent region/field, and common per-region 2D Domains. Units for rate area-integrals [s^-1 um^-1].
- **Clean_QW2(InGaN)** (Domain=5.984982e-03 um²): Radiative=8.331490e+01 (=83.3149), srh=5.464576e+04 (=54645.76), Auger=1.736316e+00 (=1.736316).
- **DmgL_QW2(InGaN)** (Domain=1.499994e-05 um²): Radiative=1.672872e-01 (=0.1672872), srh=1.416049e+02 (=141.6049), Auger=3.800247e-03 (=0.003800247).
- Derived nonoverlapping **full QW2 Half-domain** sums: Rrad=**83.4821872**; SRH=**54787.3649**; Auger=**1.740116247**; All=**54872.587203447** [s^-1 um^-1], Total Area=0.00599998194 um². Derived `IQE_rec,QW2=100*Rrad/(Rrad+SRH+Auger)=0.1521382378%`; SRH share=99.8446906%, Auger share=0.00317119%. IMPORTANT: **QW2-only**, not device IQE/EQE; QW1 pending and physics unvalidated. Comparators QW3=0.0454256871%, QW4=0.1082525242%, all QW-only.
- Same user terminal ran read-only `grep -niE 'Lifetime|Tau|Radiative|SRH|Auger|DefaultParametersFromFile|AreaFactor' pp2_des.cmd FASTC1_pp6_des.par | head -n 90`: `pp2_des.cmd:68 DefaultParametersFromFile`, lines 80/82/84 `SRH()`, `Auger()`, `Radiative`; lines 398–406 desired output fields; NO explicit lifetime/Tau/Radiative coefficient/AreaFactor matched in these two files. This proves model declarations and default-parameter flag but **NOT** the numerical effective lifetime/radiative coefficients; material DB and log remain to be checked. No right to conclude unphysical defaults or that Radiative coefficient is zero without material model verification.
- Next: run QW1 six standalone 2D region integrations (Clean_QW1 and DmgL_QW1, each Radiative/srh/Auger); sum four QW integrals to compute recombination-based full MQW fraction. In parallel inspect actual effective SDevice material SRH/radiative coefficients and 2D terminal J/AreaFactor; do not modify source or rerun, Common Baseline still not frozen, A/B NO-GO.

## 2026-10-09 — Four MQW 5V half-device area-integrated recombination ratios completed (OBSERVED + DERIVED)

- Worker: 이택규. Six direct SVisual `n2_des` Field Integration screenshots completed Clean_QW1 and DmgL_QW1 2D regions at 5V on `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` NtSide=0 Half+Coarse. Clean_QW1, domain=5.985012e-3 um²: Radiative=8.579041e2, srh=7.765839e4, Auger=2.525448e2 [s^-1 um^-1]. DmgL_QW1, domain=1.500002e-5 um²: Radiative=1.946374e1, srh=4.966036e2, Auger=2.309115e0 [s^-1 um^-1]. All six corresponding fields and 2D region names verified from screenshots.
- Derived QW1 complete Half-domain Clean+DmgL: Rrad=877.36784; SRH=78154.9936; Auger=254.853915; Total=79287.215355 [s^-1 um^-1], recombination-based well radiative fraction 1.1065691185%.
- Prior QW2 totals: Rrad 83.4821872, SRH 54787.3649, Auger 1.740116247, well fraction 0.1521382378%; QW3 totals Rrad 266.237818, SRH 585816.349, Auger 12.71478334, well fraction 0.0454256871%; QW4 totals Rrad 38845.728, SRH 35844186.2, Auger 1330.397354, well fraction 0.1082525242%. All original user SVisual screenshots already separately logged.
- **NEW derived four-QW total** (independent Clean and DmgL 2D area integral sums in same units s^-1 um^-1): Rrad=40072.8158452; SRH=36562944.9075; Auger=1599.706168587; total three-rate recombination=36604617.4295138. **MQW recombination-based radiative share = 100*Rrad/Total=0.1094747566%**; SRH share=99.8861550%; Auger share=0.00437023%. QW4 contributed 96.9378547% of measured integrated MQW Rrad. The single-well 1.10657% QW1 ratio must NOT be averaged with other well ratios to get this total.
- **Scope/limitations**: This is only the 4-InGaN-QW recombination-based ratio at one simulated 5V step in the Half+Coarse NtSide=0 2D deck; it is NOT experimental LED IQE/EQE nor complete optical output, injection efficiency, or proof of sound reference physics. SVisual reports 2D integration [s^-1 um^-1], so true absolute total requires depth/current-area normalization. Presence of `DefaultParametersFromFile`, `SRH()`, `Auger()`, `Radiative` in pp2 does NOT establish numerical lifetimes or radiative coefficients. Existing reported endpoint current 1.44801646079583e-11 in n2_des.plt requires dimension/unit validation. High SRH under NtSide=0 and QW4 dominance require material model, hole injection/polarization, steady-state and current normalization audit BEFORE baseline freeze or A/B operation. No 5V data or source modified, no rerun.

## 2026-10-09 — Literature cross-check & Baseline rerun GO/NO-GO after 5V_TEST low MQW efficiency (REVIEWED, not new simulation)

- Worker 이택규 supplied actual n2_des.log sections. Observed DefaultParametersFromFile loads T-2022.03 MaterialDB/InGaN.par and InN.par, and ModelParameters FASTC1_pp6_des.par, Grid n1_msh.tdr, Current n2_des.plt; log says no separate Lifetime file. This does NOT mean SRH is off or there is no lifetime: active MaterialDB Scharfetter section provides it. The global default block 'Use Si parameters' / 'Without incomplete ionization' cannot be assigned to active InGaN wells or Mg settings without region context. No override coefficients or final mole-fraction interpolation verified yet.
- **Peer-reviewed basis**: Kou et al. Optics Express 2019 DOI 10.1364/OE.27.00A643 uses Auger 1e-30 cm6/s, SRH numerical lifetime 1e-7 (paper displays unit s^-1, which is inconsistent with lifetime and must be flagged as a likely notation error, not ignored); Baek et al. Nature Communications 2023 DOI 10.1038/s41467-023-36773-w simulation uses SRH 100ns, Radiative 1e-10 cm3/s, Auger 1e-31 cm6/s, with a DIFFERENT 6-QW epitaxy and fitted polarization/interface assumptions. Low-current SRH dominance also discussed in Nanoscale Research Letters 2021 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8175512/. None uniquely fixes our model values without calibration.
- **Existing vendor file**: InGaN.par explicitly warns GaAs-derived SRH/Auger/Radiative parameters require calibration; Scharfetter taumax 1e-9 s; Rrad C=2e-10; Auger A=1e-30. File values are not yet proven to be final effective xIn=0.15 parameters. Relative to published 100ns example the file taumax is 100 times shorter, potentially explaining large SRH but not a proved sole root cause.
- Existing 5V NtSide0 Half+Coarse integrated 4 QWs Clean+DmgL: Rrad 40072.8158452, SRH 36562944.9075, Auger 1599.706168587 [s^-1 um^-1], fraction 0.1094747566%. Source no user code changes. QW4 ~96.94% of Rrad integral. 2D PLT terminal current raw =1.44801646079583e-11, dimension and AreaFactor still unresolved. From 2D QW3 area 0.00600001202um2 and QW thickness 0.003um, inferred Half width approximately 2um: **CONDITIONAL** on no scaling and A/um terminal current, J_5V ≈ 1.448e-11 / 2 × 1e8 ≈ 7.24e-4 A/cm2, much less than literature 0.1 A/cm2 low-current example; this is NOT verified operating J.
- **Verdict**: No evidence the nominal four-QW Kou-based geometry itself must be rebuilt; no validation of a publishable absolute IQE/optical LED baseline. Need to resolve active material parameters, low current density, carrier injection/polarization, steady-state validity and Half-vs-Full reference. Current IQE issue **must be addressed or clearly bounded** before using baseline for credible Project A/B SRH/IQE improvement conclusions. Causality not established. No new long run now; original finished files protected.
- **Stage plan** (proposal only): (1) read-only pp2/log/material model precedence and QW In mole interpolation, 2D J and equivalent 2D Half area, carrier/hole density and interface traps; (2) literature-supported calibrated parameter *separate branch* including tau sensitivity 1ns/10ns/100ns as exploratory, not automatic performance tuning; compare at same J and keep nominal sidewall Trap; (3) Short NtSide0 QS/steady + checkpoint pilot, electrical/optical checks; (4) NtSide1e18 matched-current sidewall contrast; (5) Mesh convergence and Full-vs-Half, 4/10/20um and Nt sensitivity for paper; (6) only then freeze revised physical Baseline, Project A/B null-control/pilot and broader DOE. Must not silently alter original source.

## 2026-10-09 — Live pp2_des.cmd partial physics grep: region incomplete-ionization + traps, BE transient (OBSERVED)

- Worker 이택규 sent live read-only terminal output from `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`. `sed -n '55,110p' pp2_des.cmd` confirms `Fermi`, `Thermionic`, `Piezoelectric_Polarization(strain)`, `DefaultParametersFromFile`, `EffectiveIntrinsicDensity(NoBandgapNarrowing)`, `Recombination(SRH(),Auger(),Radiative)`, Masetti/CaugheyThomas/Lombardi mobility, `Aniso`.
- `grep -niE 'IncompleteIonization|MoleFraction|Piezoelectric|Traps|AreaFactor|Quasistationary|Transient' pp2_des.cmd FASTC1_pp6_des.par` finds **IncompleteIonization on pp2 lines 128 and 137**, many **Traps declarations lines 141–361**, `xMolefraction/yMolefraction` plot fields lines 486/488, `Transient=BE` line 515 and `Transient(` line 585. **No visible AreaFactor or Quasistationary in the two scanned files.**
- Interpret conservatively: previous global-default `Without incomplete ionization` log entry does not prove region-specific Mg ionization disabled; need inspect actual Physics scope lines 115–170 and region parameter settings. The presence of Trap statements even for `NtSide=0` does not prove finite active traps; inspect real `Conc`, trap types, region names and possible `0` concentration in actual pp2. `Transient=BE` confirms time-dependent solver, so having reached 5 V and produced normal termination is NOT proof of steady DC equilibrium; compare same-bias QS/hold only after confirming physics and numerical convergence. xMolefraction plot declaration is NOT evidence the actual alloy composition assignment has been checked; verify SDE mesh/material.
- Existing InGaN.par is GaAs-derived and warns lifetime/Rad/Auger need calibration; actual QW effective alloy values, 2D current normalization and SRH model remain unverified. Existing 4-QW recombination share 0.1094747566% cannot be used as validated experimental IQE/EQE. No source edits or rerun in this turn.
- NEXT csh-safe read-only: `sed -n '112,175p' pp2_des.cmd` to confirm ionization and first sidewall trap region/Conc and `sed -n '505,615p' pp2_des.cmd` to confirm bias ramp, final time/goal, BE step and possible hold. If Trap conc is zero in n2 confirm explicitly; do not infer solely from label `NtSide=0`. Preserve completed 5V outputs/full references.

## 2026-10-09 — SWB Create Parameter File dialog and silicon-vs-GaN misconception; controlled baseline calibration plan (OBSERVED + REVIEWED)

- Worker 이택규 screenshot: SWB title shows **/user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB** (the *original branch*, NOT already-completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST`). Dialog `Create Parameter File`: **`Parameter file sdevice.par does not exist`**, radio choices `Silicon` default selected, `Choose Materials`, `Create Empty File`; scenario `NtSide=0`, SDE→SDEVICE.
- This is an **input-generation dialog** not an SDevice error or proof the existing 5V simulation used Silicon physics. Actual completed 5V_TEST n2_des.log lists `ModelParameters file: FASTC1_pp6_des.par`, `DefaultParametersFromFile` loading GaN/InGaN/InN MaterialDB, and a working 5V curve trace; that branch's `pp2_des.cmd` has region-specific incomplete ionization and `NtSide=0` ALL 12 sidewall `Conc=0` entries preprocessed (already earlier recorded in LIVE_STATE JSON). Do not confuse same old SWB input-file workflow with 5V_TEST source.
- Synopsys SWB User Guide (publicly accessible N-2017.09 pages 65–68, https://studylib.net/doc/28266667/swb-ug) documents `Tool > Edit Input > Parameter` then `Choose Materials` and selection, copies chosen release MaterialDB files into project and includes `Material="GaN" { #includeext ... }` etc in sdevice.par; Silicon default merely generates Silicon material file; `Create Empty File` possible. Tool properties can use common `sdevice.par` or per-tool .par. Sentaurus Device default physical parameters have builtin/material DB/custom parameter file precedence; blindly generating/using a new sdevice.par can overwrite working FASTC1_pp6_des.par customization (e.g., lattice/polarization/thermionic and Magnesium ionization), and merely copying the uncalibrated GaAs-derived InGaN.par does NOT improve recombination IQE.
- Intended mesh materials in Common Baseline: GaN, InGaN, AlGaN, Nitride (Si3N4); InN relevant as InGaN constituent and file-loader but not necessarily an explicitly meshed domain. Confirm exact mesh material names before choosing in a NEW clone. Danger: picking only GaN does not set all InGaN/AlGaN regions to GaN; material assignment is in SDE/TDR.
- **Immediate safe recommendation**: Cancel current parameter creation in original JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_SWB, do NOT hit OK with Silicon or generate any .par there, do NOT rerun there yet. Clone known 5V_TEST to separate calibration sandbox after backing up existing source and results, audit `File{Parameters}` of active sdevice source and actual pp2_des.par/FASTC1_pp6_des.par before integrating a region/material-specific calibration par.
- As of 2026-10-08 JuSubin timeline (documented, not necessarily new actions today): Half+coarse mesh 138,194 elements/65,513 points versus Full 290,814; half+coarse equivalence to Full unverified; Mg/n-GaN doping-profile physical validation not complete; QS 0.3V pilot proposed; later LeeTaekGyu Oct9 run of QS Copy failed at **0.019304636 V** with Newton 15 iterations then MinStep; physical cause unresolved. Additional sidewall trap-ON NtSide=1e18 in accelerated Half branch unverified. C2 save/load reference gating remains separate.
- New blocker classification: P0 preserve original proven 5V_TEST source and metadata, establish exact active materials and .par custom overrides; P1 check doping/currents/2D AreaFactor and material B/SRH lifetime, NtSide0 region trap status; P2 conditional calibration branch and short smoke/QS/Transient checks; P3 NtSide1e18 at matched J; P4 Half+Coarse vs Full/mesh and no-project modification without explicit approval. Issue #7 append only.

## 2026-10-09 — Completed 5V_TEST n2 SDevice preprocessed 12 sidewall traps all OFF (OBSERVED / VERIFIED)

- Worker 이택규 executed directly `grep -nE 'Physics \\(Region=|IncompleteIonization|Traps|Conc[[:space:]]*=' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp2_des.cmd`, showing physical-region declarations. `Clean_pGaN` `IncompleteIonization` line 128 and `DmgL_pGaN` `IncompleteIonization` line 137.
- Every one of **12 separate preprocessed left damaged-region traps has `Conc=0`**: DmgL_pGaN (line 145), DmgL_EBL (165), DmgL_Barrier0 (185), DmgL_QW1 (205), DmgL_Barrier1 (225), DmgL_QW2 (245), DmgL_Barrier2 (265), DmgL_QW3 (285), DmgL_Barrier3 (305), DmgL_QW4 (325), DmgL_Barrier4 (345), DmgL_nGaN (365). This is **confirmed Trap OFF** for all model's parameterized `DmgL_` sidewall trap regions in completed 5V NtSide=0 deck, not just two example regions. No right-side traps expected in symmetric Half.
- Scientific boundary: global `Recombination(SRH(),Auger(),Radiative)` remains ON and can generate a high baseline SRH without parameterized NtSide traps. Thus measured 5V all-QW SRH fraction 99.886% CANNOT be attributed to any of these explicit sidewall trap concentrations (zero). Cannot conclude sidewall physical damage is absent in reality, or that all other SRH and interface recombination in model is eliminated.
- Mg incomplete ionization `Physics` declarations shown for Clean/DmgL pGaN, but actual Mg donor concentration placement and free-carrier profile are STILL UNVALIDATED. `NtSide=1e18` counterpart also has NOT passed SDevice 5V convergence; no Full/Half+coarse matching, 2D J normalization, material lifetime or transient steady-state acceptance.
- NEXT READ ONLY: inspect preprocessed `pp1_dvs.cmd` from completed `JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST` for `sdedr:define-constant-profile`, placements and `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration` / n donors, then verify n1_msh.tdr concentration profiles in SVisual. No new run or changes.

## 2026-10-09 — Active 5V_TEST SDE numeric doping constants observed (NOT an error conclusion)

- 이택규 ran `grep -nE -C 3 'N_Mg_p|N_A_EBL|N_D_n|x_Al_EBL' .../JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd | head -n 100`. Live SDE shows `x_In=0.15` at line 100, `x_Al_EBL=0.15` at line 102, `N_Mg_p=9.59e18 cm^-3` at line 119, `N_A_EBL=3e17` at 121, `N_D_n=5e18` at 123, `N_D_bar=1e15` at 125. Prior lines 501-615 show these variables assigned to intended pGaN, EBL, nGaN/base regions.
- **Critical semantic distinction**: `CMP/COMMON_BASELINE.md` documents `p-GaN effective active acceptor≈3e17 cm^-3`, while SDE assigns **raw `pMagnesiumActiveConcentration`=9.59e18 cm^-3**, with specific GaN `IncompleteIonization` and E0=0.2eV etc in SDevice. This is NOT automatically an error: Mg dopant density ≠ actual ionized Mg acceptor concentration, hole density, or effective active acceptor density. But the intended correspondence to documented 3e17 target is NOT YET CALIBRATED/VERIFIED; do not call 9.59e18 physically valid just from ionization declaration. Very high Mg input may present compensation/solubility concerns needing later literature physical validation.
- `N_A_EBL=3e17, N_D_n=5e18, N_D_bar=1e15, x_In=0.15, x_Al_EBL=0.15` match nominal documented model values (subject to actual SDE material/profile assignment). No code or simulation errors in this grep, no need to rerun now.
- JuSubin TIMELINE earlier records a Half+Coarse `DopingConcentration` SVisual screenshot color scale near -9.59e18 to +5e18, suggestive of signed *input/net dopant profile* representation but no pointwise verified ionized Mg/free-hole density or across-layer cutline. Do not equate `DopingConcentration` with p or ionized Mg.
- NEXT read-only, csh-safe: `sed -n '105,128p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd` (inspect inline comments on rationale for 9.59e18); then probe existing n2_des.tdr for `pMagnesiumMinusConcentration`, `hDensity`, `DopingConcentration` in central Clean_pGaN away from contacts and verify 3e17 target only if this is the intended metric. Later calibration/low-current analysis separately. Preserve all sources/data; no new run.

## 2026-10-09 — SDE Mg calibration rationale from actual 5V_TEST comment (OBSERVED COMMENT, NOT MEASURED hDensity)

- 이택규 read `sed -n '105,128p' /user/semi/semi437/tmp/myproject/JUSUBIN_FAST_HALF_5V_TEST/pp1_dvs.cmd`. Source comment says: `Mg concentration calibrated previously in this project so that hDensity ~ 3e17 cm^-3 at 300 K with incomplete ionization.` Defined Mg input `N_Mg_p=9.59e18 cm^-3`; EBL effective active acceptor `N_A_EBL=3e17`; n-GaN donor `N_D_n=5e18`; barrier background `N_D_bar=1e15`.
- Distinguish **commented historical calibration intention** from actual reproducible `hDensity`/ionized Mg values: no p-GaN carrier-density probe or calibration condition/equilibrium state was supplied. The comment does NOT prove the current 5 V transient p-GaN `hDensity=3e17`, especially near interfaces/bias. Mg raw input 9.59e18 need NOT be changed to 3e17; do not modify existing .par or do an unnecessary SDE rerun.
- Next action: open preserved `n2_des.tdr` in SVisual, inspect `hDensity` as a 2D field in `Clean_pGaN` at a representative bulk point away from junction/contacts, record coordinates/units/value and bias (5 V). Where available also inspect `pMagnesiumMinusConcentration` (ionized Mg) from same data; check initial 0 V/equilibrium TDR or original calibration artifact before claiming 300 K zero-bias target 3e17 truly reproduced. Do not equate pMagnesiumActiveConcentration or DopingConcentration with free hole density.
- 12/12 NtSide0 sidewall traps verified zero and SDE Mg/EBL/n donor source placements checked earlier. Remaining: effective Mg/holes, donor actual map, 2D J normalization, InGaN SRH calibration and Full/Half comparison. No new run.
